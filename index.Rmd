# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction book club! 

This website is a companion for the book [_Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction_](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) by Kevin Patrick Murphy (copyright 2022).
This companion is available at [dslc.io/pml](https://dslc.io/pml).

This website is being developed by the [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io). Follow along, and [join the community](https://dslc.io/join) to participate.

This companion follows the [Data Science Learning Community Code of Conduct](https://dslc.io/code_of_conduct.html).

## Book club meetings {-}

- Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book (or part of a chapter).
  - **This is the best way to learn the material!**
- Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter.
- More information about how to present is available in the [github repo](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-pml).
- Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the [Data Science Learning Community YouTube Channel](https://dslc.io/youtube).

## Pace {-}

- We'll _try_ to cover 1 chapter/week, but...
- ...It's ok to split chapters when they feel like too much.
- We will try to meet every week, but will likely take some breaks for holidays, etc.
